## What is Algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

## Algorithm Characteristics

-   Well defined inputs and outputs.
-   Each step should be clear and unambiguous.
-   Language independent.

## How to represent complexity?

**Asymptotic notations:**

-   Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity:

1. **Big-O Notation** (O-notation) - Worst case complexity;
2. **Omega Notation** (O-notation) - Best case complexity;
3. **Theta Notation** (Â©-notation) - Average case complexity;
